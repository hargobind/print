INSTALLATION
------------

Decompress the print-n.x-n.n.tar.gz file into your Drupal modules
directory (usually sites/all/modules, see http://drupal.org/node/176044 for
more information).

Enable the print module: Administer > Site building > Modules
  (admin/build/modules)

PDF TOOL
--------

The print_pdf module requires the use of an external PDF generation tool.
The currently supported tools are dompdf, TCPDF and wkhtmltopdf.  Please
note that any errors/bugs in those tools need to be reported and fixed by
their maintainers.  DO NOT report bugs in those tools in the print module's
issue queue at Drupal.org.

supported paths:
  * print module lib directory (usually sites/all/modules/print/lib)
  * libraries directory (sites/all/libraries)

dompdf support:
  The dompdf tool produces results that are more faithful to the HTML
  printer-friendly page. Good support of CSS 2.1 and partially CSS3.

  The recommended version of this tool is 0.8.2 since it is fully compatible
  with PHP 7.1, and security support has ended for all prior versions of PHP
  as of December 31, 2018.

  1. Download dompdf from https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf/releases. Make
  sure to download the full release zipfile. If you download only a source
  code file, you will also need to download and install the php-font-lib.
  2. Extract the contents of the downloaded package into one of the
  supported paths.
  3. Grant write access to the lib/fonts directory for your webserver user.
  4. Review the recommendations for securing your dompdf installation at
  https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf/wiki/Securing-dompdf
  5. If upgrading to 0.7 (or newer) from 0.6 (or older), visit the settings
  page on your site at http://www.example.com/admin/settings/print/pdf
  and select the new path for the "PDF generation tool" setting.
  6. Check https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf/ for further information.

TCPDF support:
  TCPDF seems to be more actively developed than dompdf, but it's support
  for CSS is considerably worse. Unicode is supported (use of Unicode fonts
  result in HUGE files). Page header and footer are supported. This module
  requires TCPDF >= 4.0.000.

  1. Download TCPDF from http://sourceforge.net/projects/tcpdf/
  2. Extract the contents of the downloaded package into one of the
  supported paths.  There is no need to modify the config/tcpdf_config.php
  file, as the module self-configures TCPDF.
  3. Grant write access to the cache and images directories to your
  webserver user.
  4. Check http://tcpdf.sourceforge.net/ for further information.

wkhtmltopdf support:

  1. Download wkhtmltopdf from
  https://github.com/wkhtmltopdf/wkhtmltopdf/releases. You can choose to
  download the source and compile it or simply download the static binary,
  which doesn't require you to compile anything. Note that the compiled
  version may require a running X server (static uses patched libs that can
  work without one).
  2. Place the wkhtmltopdf executable into one of the supported paths. 
  (usually sites/all/modules/print/lib).  You can also place a symbolic link
  to the executable.
  3. Check https://github.com/wkhtmltopdf/wkhtmltopdf/ for further information.

UPDATE
------

When updating from a previous version, just remove the print directory and
follow the instructions above. Make sure that you backup any costumization
to the print.tpl.php and print.css files.

ROBOTS
------

Even though it is possible to set per-page robots settings, the following
can be placed in your robots.txt file after the User-agent line to prevent
search engines from even asking for the page:

Disallow: /print/

Also, for updates from older versions (<=4.7.x-1.0 and <=5.x-1.2) which used
node/nnn/print instead of print/nnn, the following lines can prevent
requests from Google for the obsolete print URLs:

Disallow: /*/print$

Note that pattern matching in robots.txt is a Google extension (see
http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=40367 for more
information).
